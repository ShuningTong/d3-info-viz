## d3-info-viz

These are some practice files and homework submissions for information visualization using d3.js.

We use various techniques (barchart, linechart, geomap, transition, interaction, etc.) to make beautiful visualizations to help better understanding data.

This repo will be updated often in Fall 2016, and probably continue to be updated in the future.

If you are interested in data visualization and / or d3.js, feel free to fork us.
